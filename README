NAME
    DataFlow::Proc::HTMLFilter - A HTML filtering processor

VERSION
    version 1.112100

SYNOPSIS
        use DataFlow::Proc::HTMLFilter;

        my $filter_html = DataFlow::Proc::HTMLFilter->new(
            search_xpath => '//td',
            result_type  => 'HTML',
            );

        my $filter_value = DataFlow::Proc::HTMLFilter->new(
            search_xpath => '//td',
            result_type  => 'VALUE',
            );

        my $input = <<EOM;
        <html><body>
          <table>
            <tr><td>Line 1</td><td>L1, Column 2</td>
            <tr><td>Line 2</td><td>L2, Column 2</td>
          </table>
        </html></body>
        EOM

        $filter_html->process( $input );
        # @result == '<td>Line 1</td>', ... '<td>L2, Column 2</td>'

        $filter_value->process( $input );
        # @result == q{Line 1}, ... q{L2, Column 2}

DESCRIPTION
    This processor type provides a filter for HTML content. Each item will
    be considered as a HTML content and will be filtered using
    HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath.

ATTRIBUTES
  search_xpath
    This attribute is a XPath string used to filter down the HTML content.
    The "search_xpath" attribute is mandatory.

  result_type
    This attribute is a string, but its value must be one of: "HTML",
    "VALUE", "NODE". The default is "HTML".

    *   HTML

        The result will be the HTML content specified by "search_xpath".

    *   VALUE

        The result will be the literal value enclosed by the tag and/or
        attribute specified by "search_xpath".

    *   NODE

        The result will be a list of HTML::Element objects, as returned by
        the "findnodes" method of HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath class.

    Most people will probably use "HTML" or "VALUE", but this option is also
    provided in case someone wants to manipulate the HTML elements directly.

  ref_result
    This attribute is a boolean, and it signals whether the result list
    should be added as a list of items to the output queue, or as a
    reference to an array of items. The default is 0 (false).

    There is a semantic subtlety here: if "ref_result" is 1 (true), then one
    HTML item (input) may generate one or zero ArrayRef item (output), i.e.
    it is a one-to-one mapping. On the other hand, by keeping "ref_result"
    as 0 (false), one HTML item may produce any number of items as result,
    i.e. it is a one-to-many mapping.
