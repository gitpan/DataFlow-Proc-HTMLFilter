DataFlow::Proc::HTMLFilter - A HTML filtering processor

=head1 VERSION

version 1.111762

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DataFlow::Proc::HTMLFilter;

    my $filter_html = DataFlow::Proc::HTMLFilter->new(
        search_xpath => '//td',
    	result_type  => 'HTML',
	);

    my $filter_value = DataFlow::Proc::HTMLFilter->new(
        search_xpath => '//td',
    	result_type  => 'VALUE',
	);

    my $input = <<EOM;
    <html><body>
      <table>
        <tr><td>Line 1</td><td>L1, Column 2</td>
        <tr><td>Line 2</td><td>L2, Column 2</td>
      </table>
    </html></body>
    EOM

    $filter_html->process( $input );
    # @result == '<td>Line 1</td>', ... '<td>L2, Column 2</td>'

    $filter_value->process( $input );
    # @result == q{Line 1}, ... q{L2, Column 2}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This processor type provides a filter for HTML content.
Each item will be considered as a HTML content and will be filtered
using L<HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 search_xpath

This attribute is a XPath string used to filter down the HTML content.
The C<search_xpath> attribute is mandatory.

=head2 result_type

This attribute is a string, but its value B<must> be one of:
C<HTML>, C<VALUE>, C<NODE>. The default is C<HTML>.

=over

=item HTML

The result will be the HTML content specified by C<search_xpath>.

=item VALUE

The result will be the literal value enclosed by the tag and/or attribute
specified by C<search_xpath>.

=item NODE

The result will be a list of L<HTML::Element> objects, as returned by the
C<findnodes> method of L<HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath> class.

=back

Most people will probably use C<HTML> or C<VALUE>, but this option is also
provided in case someone wants to manipulate the HTML elements directly.

=head2 ref_result

This attribute is a boolean, and it signals whether the result list should be
added as a list of items to the output queue, or as a reference to an array
of items. The default is 0 (false).

There is a semantic subtlety here: if C<ref_result> is 1 (true),
then one HTML item (input) may generate one or zero ArrayRef item (output),
i.e. it is a one-to-one mapping.
On the other hand, by keeping C<ref_result> as 0 (false), one HTML item
may produce any number of items as result,
i.e. it is a one-to-many mapping.
